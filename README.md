# graph-stringify

A simple way to produce a compact string representation of an object graph, one node per line. Nodes are tagged with a unique id to properly handle nodes that appear multiple times, as well as cycles.

## Installation

Install via:

```
npm install graph-stringify
```

The sole function is available as the default:

```js
import stringify from "graph-stringify";
```

## Usage

### stringify(obj)

Accepts a single object argument.

Basic primitives such as `undefined`, `null`, numbers, bigints, booleans, strings, and symbols are ignored when passed directly to this function.

If an object is received, its object graph is written with one node per line. Each line contains the nodeâ€™s constructor name followed by a list of its properties in `name=value` format. Non-object values are output in place with `util.inspect`, function values are output as `<Function>`, and object values (including arrays) are written in subsequent lines and referred to by a reference number.

### Examples

<table>
<tr><th>Source string</th><th>Stringified</th></tr>

<tr><td>

```
{x: 1, y: ["x", false], z: null}
```

</td><td>

```
   1 | Object x=1 y=['x',false] z=null
```

</td></tr>

<tr><td>

```
new Program([
  new Assignment("x", 3),
  new Break()
])
```

</td><td>

```
   1 | Program statements=[#2,#3]
   2 | Assignment target='x' source=3
   3 | Break
```

</td></tr>

<tr><td>

```
new Program([
  new Assignment(
    "y",
    new BinaryExpression(
      "*",
      new Call("hypot", [3, 5]), "x"
     )
  ),
])
```

</td><td>

```
1 | Program statements=[#2]
2 | Assignment target='y' source=#3
3 | BinaryExpression op='\*' left=#4 right='x'
4 | Call callee='hypot' args=[3,5]
```

</td></tr>
