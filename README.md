# graph-stringify

Compact string representation of an object graph, one node per line

## Installation

```
npm install graph-stringify
```

```js
import stringify from "graph-stringify";
```

## stringify(obj)

Accepts a single object argument.

Basic primitives such as `undefined`, `null`, numbers, bigints, booleans, strings, and symbols are ignored when passed directly to this function.

If an object is received, its object graph is written with one node per line. Each line contains the nodeâ€™s constructor name followed by a list of its properties in `name=value` format. Values that are primitive are written in place, but those that are objects (including arrays) are written in subsequent lines and referred to by a reference number.
